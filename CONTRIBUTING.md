There's no specific code of conduct yet, but you can follow the usual one:

* Be gentle
* Be supportive
* All kind of contributions are welcomed ;) (code, issues, troubleshooting, PRs, docs, etc.) 

If you want to contribute with code that means you've probably found and issue, so you can proceed to
create it and then label it as an enhance, bugfix or as a desired functionality.

That's pretty much all there is to it!
